A collection of simple erlang programs that are collected
here as I learn erlang.

Here's what's contained, and the order in which I wrote them:

echo_server - a simple tcp echo server that accepts a connection,
              echo's packets back, and exits
echo_server_multiple - a more complex tcp echo server that spawns
              one process per connection and can handle multiple
			  connections in parallel
